# Beginning GraphQL [eLearning]
Though fairly new, GraphQL is fast becoming a preferred language in API development. This course begins by teaching you all that you need to know for building efficient APIs. You will learn core GraphQL concepts, create a simple application using Node.js and Express, an HTTP middleware, and study how GraphQL integrates with other frameworks in real-world applications. This course is what you need to learn to create fast client-server REST-like applications.

## What you will learn
* Apply core GraphQL concepts to be used across different languages
* Implement the overall structure of GraphQL applications
* Use Apollo GraphQL for both server and client JavaScript applications
* Create applications using real-life business scenarios
* Explore differences between GraphQL and REST
* Discover advantages of GraphQL over REST

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel i5 (or equivalent)
* Memory: 4GB RAM
* Hard disk: 10 GB

### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Mac OS / Linux (Preferably Ubuntu 16.04) / Windows OS (Windows 7 minimum) 
* On MacOS systems, to enable developer tools, set up XCode 
* Text editor such as Visual Studio Code or any Jetbrains' text editor
